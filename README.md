# GuessTheFlag
iOS App - Made in Swift/SwiftUI

GuessTheFlag App (from HWS)


The Main goal is to create a Flag Quiz Game by selecting tapping on a selection of 3 flags, you need to get the correct flag to earn points.
In addition to this, I added an persistant (using for the moment the AppStorage) score board & an little encyclopedia of brief knowledge of countries present in the game with current location of the country selected with MapKit, by getting in real time the position of the said-so country selected
